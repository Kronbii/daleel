AI Usage & Limitations

Daleel uses artificial intelligence tools solely as an assistive mechanism for:

Transcribing public audio or video

Organizing large volumes of public information

Drafting neutral summaries for human review

AI systems do not make editorial decisions, judgments, or evaluations. All published content is reviewed by human editors.

While efforts are made to ensure accuracy, automated tools may contain errors. Daleel continuously reviews and improves its processes.
